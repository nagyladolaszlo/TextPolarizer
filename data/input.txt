The UK government has outlined its proposals on compensating for the loss of biodiversity through development.

The idea of "biodiversity offsetting" is controversial, with some campaigners dubbing it a "licence to trash".

It means developers planning to build houses in environmentally sensitive areas would be allowed to go ahead if they could offset damage by paying for conservation activities elsewhere.

The environment department Defra has published a green paper on the scheme.
